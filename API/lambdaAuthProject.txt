HOW TO SECURE API GATEWAY WITH LAMBDA AUTHORIZER 

CREATE REST API WITH LAMBDA AS A BACKEND SERVICE

If user wants to access the the api the api gateway will pass it to the aith lambda
which will authenticate , and if the authentication is sucessful 
request will be forwarded else it wont be 

so we made a rest api and connected it to a lambda : the problem is anyone can access it 
there is no security 

so we will be adding lambda AUTHORIZER to authenticate the request 
it will check for auth token and if the token is matched it'll return an IAM 
policy telling user can have the access to invoke this lambda 
based on the auth token 

policy_document = {
    'Version' : '',
    'Statement' :[
        {
            'Action' : 'execute-api:Invoke',
            'Effect': will it be allowed or denied,
            'Resource': resource
        }
    ]
} 

the lambda will populate this policy based on the auth token it is getting
