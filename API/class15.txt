How to authenticate API GATEWAY 
jab api gateway use karte hai toh kitne type ki authentication laa sakte hai 
3-5 ways to apply auth except cognito 

//generally without any auth if someone is able to hit the api link 
they will be able to invoke the lambda function 

we want only authenticated user should hit url and get the response 

ways to authenticate 
1) method request mai authorization  using aws IAM 
now create a new IAM USER , and make its ,secret and access key : 
after that attatch IAM POLICIES WITH RELATED PERMISSIONS AND THEN ITS DONE 

BEHIND THE SCENE post man ne signature banaya hai with the help of its internal aws comand 
use this method when aws ki application hii api gateway se baat karna chahiti ho
