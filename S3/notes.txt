S3 : BUCKET : ek container , jaha files rakhte hai ,
store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere

we can store unlimited amount of data : JO costing hogi storage used wise hogi 

BUCKET : AWS KE cloud mai hamare naam ka ucket bann jaaye ga , uss bucket mai we can store our files 
BUCKET is a region specific service,
it should have a unique name , similar to goodle drive ,

files choose karo and and then they will move to staging 

defination : cloud based storage service which allows us to store , manage , and retrieve large amounts of data like 
files, images, videos and Bakcups securly and at scale 

reliable , scalable internet storage making data accessible from anywhere with the help of internet 

kisi bhi jagah se kahi bhi data access krr sakte hai 


KEY POINTS : 

stores data as objects, 

Globally unique name , 

region specific : jo bucket jiss region mai banayi toh voh wahi store hoga

EACH OBJECT WITHIN A BUCKET IS STORED AS A KEY VALUE PAIR 
 

Data stored as an Object and uske andar bhi KEY VALUE pair
    
    KEY : file name , 
    VALUE : file content 
    
    S3 stores upto 5TB OF DATA 
    Multipart upload is recommended for object with size > 5GB 


NOT AVAIBILITY ZONE SPECIFIC : jaise mumbai mai agar banaya toh mumbai ke an
mumbai mai 3 zone hai then our data will be replicated there 
Agar ek zone mai problem aa gyi toh baki zones mai available hoga


HOW TO HOST A STATIC WEBSITE : 
1) upload files and assets you need 
2) then go to the host static website setting : itll give us a url 
3) then allow public access : jab humm permission provide karege apne bucket ko tabh aap acces krr paaye ge

// public ki permission kaise dete hai through bucket policies
4)change bucket policies : JSON format mai dete hai that attatch directly to S3 bucket
who can access the data and what actions they can perform , kis level ki permission de sakte hai 

we can write the policies ourselves or could use policy generator 

GET object : used to retrieve or download files from the S3 Bucket : user can only get files

//principle : matlba kisko allow karna , sabhi ko acess dena hai toh *

agar chane kiya toh file firse upload karo and then it is applied
in case of negative senario agar versioning hoti 

versioning ko enable karo , iske baad waali files hii version hogi 

S3 REPLICATION : SRR ek aur bucket bana lo usmai backup hota rahega
cross region REPLICATION if we create a rule 

MAKE BUCKET RAPLICA : of one ucket to another in same or other region 
and choose to make replica of another bucket

mian bucket--> Management----->Replication Rules----->choose source and destination buuckets  
and ralicate existing files , and create batch operating job : will continue to run when the file is uploaded 
and also generate completion report and give its path               

S3 STORAGE CLASS : jaise huumm data store krr rahe hai toh utna uske paise lagege 
aws provides different storage classes according to our need
S3 STANDARD , (HIGH FREQUENCY accessible DATA) 
S3 intelligent tiering , 
s3 standard-IA , GLACIER TYPE STORAGE

S3 EVEN OBJECT LOOKS LIKE:
